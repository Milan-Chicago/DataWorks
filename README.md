Explainable AI is one of the hottest topics in the field of Machine Learning. Machine Learning does not create black boxes that are imposible to interpret.  Models are build by humans, as a result,  we need to trust them, understand potential errors they can make, and the reasoning behind their predictions. 

In this repot, I will post weekly notebooks that provide clear examples of how we can achieve Explainable AI.
